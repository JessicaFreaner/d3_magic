This repository houses all folders of d3 visualizations to be made into [Gists](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/ "About gists") so that they can be posted on [bl.ocks](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/ "Let's Make a Block"). 


Check out [my bl.ocks user page](http://bl.ocks.org/jessicafreaner "jessicafreanerâ€™s blocks")!
